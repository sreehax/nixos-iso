# NixOS ISO with bcachefs
This project lets you easily build a NixOS ISO with bcachefs support. It can easily be modified to change the configuration to your liking.

## Prerequisites
All you need to build this is a NixOS system or any Linux or macOS system  with nix installed.

Installing nix on your system is [very simple](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/install).

## Building the ISO
You can either clone this repository and issue `nix build`, or you can run this command from anywhere you have write access: `nix build github:sreehax/nixos-iso`.
